## Option 1: Deploy to Vercel (Recommended)

### Step 1: Login to Vercel
```bash
cd /root/chatform/website
vercel login
```
This will open a browser window for you to authenticate.

### Step 2: Deploy
```bash
vercel --prod
```

Follow the prompts:
- **Set up and deploy?** → Yes
- **Which scope?** → Your account
- **Link to existing project?** → No
- **Project name?** → chatform-website (or your choice)
- **Directory?** → ./ (current directory)
- **Override settings?** → No

Vercel will:
1. Build your Next.js app
2. Deploy to a production URL
3. Give you a live link like: `https://chatform-website.vercel.app`

### Step 3: Get Your Live URL
After deployment completes, Vercel will show:
```
✅ Production: https://chatform-website-xyz.vercel.app
```

Copy this URL and open it in your browser!

## Option 2: Deploy via Vercel Dashboard

1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Click "Add New Project"
3. Import from Git (or upload the `/root/chatform/website` folder)
4. Vercel auto-detects Next.js settings
5. Click "Deploy"
6. Get your live URL in ~2 minutes

---

## Option 3: Test Locally (If you have SSH tunnel)

If you can create an SSH tunnel to this server:

```bash
# On your local machine:
ssh -L 3001:localhost:3001 user@your-server-ip

# Then open in browser:
http://localhost:3001
```

## What Happens Next?

Once deployed, you'll be able to:
1. **View the live website** at your Vercel URL
2. **Share it** with team/investors for feedback
3. **Make changes** - Vercel auto-deploys on git push
4. **Add custom domain** - Connect chatform.com when ready

---

## Current Server Status

The dev server is running at:
- **Local**: http://localhost:3001
- **Network**: http://168.231.75.32:3001

**Note**: You can't access localhost:3001 from your browser because it's running on a remote server. That's why we need to deploy to Vercel for you to see it live!

---

## Next Steps After Deployment

1. **Review the design** - Check all sections look good
2. **Give feedback** - Let me know what to change
3. **Add real screenshots** - Replace placeholder image in Hero
4. **Connect analytics** - Add Google Analytics/Plausible
5. **SEO optimization** - Add meta images, structured data
6. **Start building the app** - Move to Sprint 0 (backend setup)
